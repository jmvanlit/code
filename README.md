Citizens as Democratic Judges: When Credibility and Ambiguity Collide

Democracies worldwide face the challenge of incumbent-led autocratization. Previous research shows that citizens’ acquiescence to anti-democratic government actions is key to understanding the success of autocratization attempts. Autocratization attempts, however, do not occur in a vacuum: while government actors justify autocratization measures, opposition actors (i.e., democratic defenders) resist autocratization in the public sphere. Citizens therefore face two competing claims: the incumbent’s justification of the autocratic action and the counter-claims by the democratic defender.

Yet, research has not examined how citizens evaluate these competing claims. We argue that the autocratizing incumbent’s justification and the credibility of the democratic defender affect citizens’ perceptions of democratic quality of an action. Justifications create ambiguity around the autocratic action, cloaking whether or not it harms democracy. Similarly, not all democratic defence is credible: when the democratic defender is self-interested in preventing the autocratic action, the counter-claim might be perceived as an insincere ploy.

Focusing on the judiciary as one of the prime targets of autocratization and as last bulwark of democracy, we test these hypotheses using a factorial survey experiment in the Netherlands, Germany, and France (n = 9159). We experimentally manipulate the ambiguity of an autocratic action, the presence of a democratic defence, and the credibility of democratic defenders.

We find strong evidence that democratic defence is possible, but only under strict conditions of non-self-interest. Our findings have implications for the research on democratic resilience, as well as for democratic defenders in practice.
